# MY PORTFOLIO
Some of my recent projects 

## 1) ROCK SCISSOR PAPER WITH ML AND MEDIAPIPE 
### (IRONHACK DATA ANALITICS BOOTCAMP'S FINAL PROJECT)
### Play rock scissor paper with computer vision
I trained ML classification alghorithms that recognizes rock, scissor or paper through the camera. By showing your hand-move to the camera, it will recognize wich your current move.

## 2) GRADIENT DESCENT VISUALIZATION WITH TOUCHDESIGNER 
### It shows how the coefficient and the intercepts adjusts through the epochs

You can choose a few parameters (number of samples, slope, learning rate, initial weights... ) and whatch how weights correct themselves. It shows: 
- A 2D plot with the samples, the OLS regressione line, the errors squared and the predicted values 
- The values updating 
- The loss function 
- The current gradient descente and global minima in 2D and 3D

## 3) PREDICTING SEXUAL DISCRIMINATION 
I use Harvard University Implictit Association Test data to spot predictors of sexual discrimiation (exploratory analysis and machine learning). The fig. shows variables correlated (OLS exploratory regression) with implicit discrimination.

## 4) SONG RECOMMENDER WITH SPOTIPY API
I use unsupervised machine learning to create a song recommendation system with Spotify

## 5) SCATTERPLOT GENERATOR WITH TOUCHDESIGNER
### The projcet contains a scatterplot generator in a touchdesigner file. Upload a csv file, write down the x and y variables, and it's done (no code needed). 
Plus, it contains many more features, good both for data visualization and data exploration.
