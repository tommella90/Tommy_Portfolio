# FIRST PROJECT 
## Scatterplot generator with Touchdesigner
### The projcet contains a scatterplot generator in a touchdesigner file. Without any cooding needed, you only need to upload a csv file, write down the x and y variables, and it's done. 
Plus, it contains many more features, good both for data visualization and data exploration.
